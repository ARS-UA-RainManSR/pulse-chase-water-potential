### notes
TWo major themes:
- WP variation in time
- wP variation over spatial hierarchy

1. Run PLSR using only predawns, for WC and WP, and compare to PLSR using predawns and middays. What are the different regions associated with?
  1a. Hypothesis: Predawns will associate more with structural traits, while including middays will include more chlorophyll-associated traits. All will include water absorption features. 
  1b. Hypothesis: WC will have stronger correlation when PD only, but WP will have stronger correlation when both PD and MD are included. 
  
2. Run PLSR with both PD and MD, WP and WC, to retain temporal sensitivity, but try with with and without the major water aborption features to imitate what can be achieve from airborne or spaceborne platforms. 
  2a. Hypothesis: Diurnal variation in water potential will still be strongly associated with hyperspectral without water absorption features, but diurnal variation in water content will be less strongly correlated. 
  
  Can we predict water potential with function of water content (spectroscopy), VPD, SWC?
